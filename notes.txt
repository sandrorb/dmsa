Reminder:

2014/05/04:
	1. Maybe: refactoring in order to make classes out of rim, seringa and padrao from dmsa;
	2. Maybe: improve functions to handle incorrect input format;  
	3. Improve GUI: Make the window no resizable. I set sizePolicy to fixed, but it didn't work.
	4. There are 4 Warning regarding a name "layoutWidget" already in use. They seem
	   to be related to 4 results fields.
	5. Put the calculation out of MainWindow.
	6. Time is in seconds? Hight is always in cm?
	7. Make intrinsic calculation tests.
		a. Put factorK = 1 to see the crude results.
	8. To check: all text have right alignment, but I think it's not the case in the win version.


Notes for cross compilation:     

~/mxe/usr/i686-pc-mingw32.static/qt/bin/qmake TesteSrB.pro

Mudar em Makefile.Release (ou Makefile.Debug) coisas como:

CC = gcc para CC = /Users/sandro/mxe/usr/bin/i686-pc-mingw32.static-gcc
e CXX = g++ para CXX = /Users/sandro/mxe/usr/bin/i686-pc-mingw32.static-g++
e LINK = g++ para LINK =  /Users/sandro/mxe/usr/bin/i686-pc-mingw32.static-g++

make -f Makefile.Release
