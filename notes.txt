Reminder:

I did some data validation for time fields. Although it's working, it's not ok. A lot of 
effort must be done to separate and organise data, validation and presentation.

	0. Maybe Dmsa class shouldn't be ware of UI. See comment inside the class.
	1. Maybe: refactoring in order to make classes out of rim, seringa and padrao from dmsa;
	2. Maybe: improve functions to handle incorrect input format; 
	3. Improve GUI: Make the window no resizable. I set sizePolicy to fixed, but it didn't work.
	4. Hight is always in cm? Time in seconds worked in some tests. It seems that it can
	   be in any (integer) unit.
	5. To check: all text have right alignment, but I think it's not the case in the win version.


Notes for cross compilation:     

~/mxe/usr/i686-pc-mingw32.static/qt/bin/qmake TesteSrB.pro

Mudar em Makefile.Release (ou Makefile.Debug) coisas como:

CC = gcc para CC = /Users/sandro/mxe/usr/bin/i686-pc-mingw32.static-gcc
e CXX = g++ para CXX = /Users/sandro/mxe/usr/bin/i686-pc-mingw32.static-g++
e LINK = g++ para LINK =  /Users/sandro/mxe/usr/bin/i686-pc-mingw32.static-g++

export PATH=$PATH:/Users/sandro/mxe/usr/bin
make -f Makefile.Release
