Reminder:

2014/06/10:
	1. Maybe Dmsa class shouldn't be ware of UI. See comment inside the class.
	2. Maybe: refactoring in order to make classes out of rim, seringa and padrao from dmsa;
	3. All fields have validation, but it's still kind of messy. It's important to check
	   the limits for age, hight and weight in the equation.
	4. Improve GUI: Make the window no resizable. I set sizePolicy to fixed, but it didn't work.
	5. Hight is always in cm? Time in seconds worked in some tests. It seems that it can
	   be in any (integer) unit.
	6. To check: all text have right alignment, but I think it's not the case in the win version.
	7. Set up a About menu.
	8. Maybe: tooltips for the fields.
	


Notes for cross compilation:     

~/mxe/usr/i686-pc-mingw32.static/qt/bin/qmake TesteSrB.pro

Mudar em Makefile.Release (ou Makefile.Debug) coisas como:

CC = gcc para CC = /Users/sandro/mxe/usr/bin/i686-pc-mingw32.static-gcc
e CXX = g++ para CXX = /Users/sandro/mxe/usr/bin/i686-pc-mingw32.static-g++
e LINK = g++ para LINK =  /Users/sandro/mxe/usr/bin/i686-pc-mingw32.static-g++

export PATH=$PATH:/Users/sandro/mxe/usr/bin
make -f Makefile.Release
