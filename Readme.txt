Program being developed in Qt/C++ for MacOSX to calculate the DMSA absolut uptake
in nuclear medicine. This project has been developed to learn C++ and Qt.

The MacOSX executable lives in the folder "executable". Its name is dmsa.app (MacOSX 
applications rest in a folder). To run it, download the entire project (see the download
link on the right) and double click the "folder" app.

If a file dmsa.exe is found in the executable folder, this file is a windows
executable which was cross compiled in MacOSX for windows using MXE tool.
