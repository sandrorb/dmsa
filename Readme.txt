Program being developed in Qt/C++ for MacOSX to calculate the DMSA absolut uptake
in nuclear medicine. This project has been developed to learn C++ and Qt.

The MacOSX executable lives in the folder "executable". Its name is dmsa.app (MacOSX 
applications rest in a folder). To run it, download the entire project (see the download
link on the right) and double click the "folder" app. Alternatively, one can download
the project from the page: http://sandrorb.github.io/dmsa.

If a file like dmsa.exe or dmsa*.exe is found in the executable folder, it means a 
windows version has been issued for this MacOSX's application version. Windows version
has been obtained by cross compilation of the MacOSX version using MXE tool.

If you decide to download and test it or use it, please let me know and/or report your
experience using it.
