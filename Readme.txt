Program being developed in Qt/C++ for MacOSX to calculate the DMSA absolute uptake
in nuclear medicine. This project has been developed to learn C++ and Qt.

The MacOSX executable lives in the folder "executable". Its name is dmsa.app (MacOSX 
applications rest in a folder). To run it, download the entire project (see the download
link on the right) and double click the "folder" app. Alternatively, one can download
the project from the page: http://sandrorb.github.io/dmsa.

In the executable folder there is a file called dmsa-qt-win.exe which is the windows 
version. This version has been obtained by cross compilation of the MacOSX version 
using MXE tool.

If you decide to download and test it or use it, please let me know and/or report your
experience using it.
